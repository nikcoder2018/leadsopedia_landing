                    B2B list building, in a nutshell, involves creating a list of contacts whom you can reach out to and
                    nurture as leads. If you’re wondering what the differences between B2B prospecting lists, B2B prospect
                    lists, and B2B marketing lists are, the answer is that they’re exactly the same. The terms are 100%
                    interchangeable, and you can use whichever one works for you!

                    Now, the goal with B2B list building is to create a list that’s highly accurate and targeted. You don’t
                    want to spend weeks or even months emailing a lead on your list, only to realize that this person isn’t
                    a good fit for your product, or worse — that they’re no longer working at the company. Read on to learn
                    more about the best strategies to effectively build a B2B list.

                    Before you even start building your list, you’ll want to determine who your ideal customer is. This
                    ensures that you only spend your time talking to leads who do have a genuine need for your
                    product/service, and are more likely to convert.

                    How do you do this? Simple — get everyone from the sales team to sit down together, and identify common
                    characteristics and traits that your customers possess. Here are some questions to get you on the right
                    track:

                    2. Identify the companies and decision makers you want to target
                </h3>
                <p class="lead my-5" data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="1000">
                    Now that you know who’s likely to convert to a paying customer, and what type of company they’re likely
                    to work in, make a list of companies which fit the bill. Once that’s done, hone in on the departments
                    and decision makers whom you want to get in touch with.
                </p>
                <p class="lead my-5" data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="1000">
                    If you want to reach out to established companies which have more resources to pay for your
                    product/services, you might want to use the Fortune 100, 500 or 1000 list as a starting point. After
                    you’ve compiled a list of suitable companies, you can search for leaders or decision makers in those
                    companies on LinkedIn.

                    We’re not going to lie — the research process can be pretty gruelling. Here, you’re essentially
                    cyber-stalking your leads; you’ll want to check out their social media profiles, look at their company’s
                    website, read interviews and profiles that they’ve done, and look at the press releases they’ve
                    distributed to dig out their contact information.

                    The average B2B sales and marketing database decays at over 36% per year, so if you’ve gotten a
                    prospect’s number from a press release that was disseminated in 2015, there’s a pretty high chance that
                    the number is no longer in use. Bearing this in mind, be sure to validate the contact details that
                    you’ve procured in order to make sure your list isn’t predominantly made up of junk leads.
                </p>
                <p class="lead my-5" data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-duration="1000">
                    How do you do this? Prepare a short script, then call those numbers you’ve obtained. Keep this initial
                    call short; just introduce yourself, ask your lead a couple of qualifying questions, and tell them that
                    your colleague will be getting in touch in a few days to share about how they can help your lead
                    eliminate XYZ pain point.

                    At this point, you might be thinking: dang, that sounds like a lot of work. If you don’t want to take on
                    the task of B2B list building by yourself, there are other options. You can hire an external agency to
                    help you do this (a word of caution: this will be costly), or utilize a tool such as Leadsopedia to
                    streamline your B2B list building process.

                    According to statistics, sales reps spend nearly two-thirds of their time on non revenue-generating
                    activities, and only one-third of their time on functions related to selling. If you ask us, this is a
                    huge waste. You’ve hired your reps — and invested in training them — for a reason, and it’s not so that
                    they can waste their time on administrative tasks such as trawling LinkedIn for leads.

                    you can turn your sales team into a lean, mean, revenue-generating machine. How’s that for a win-win?
