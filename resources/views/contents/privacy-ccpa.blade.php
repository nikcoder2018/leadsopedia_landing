        <h1>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</h1>
        <i>
            Last updated [February 2nd, 2021]
        </i>
        <p>
            Our CCPA Policy forms part of and must be read in conjunction with, website Terms and Conditions and Privacy policy. We reserve the right to change this CCPA Policy at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
            We respect the privacy of our users and every person who visits our sites <b>www.leadsopedia.com</b>. Here, <b>Leadsopedia Limited</b> refers to as (“we”, “us”, or “our”). We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy. If you have any questions or concerns about our policy or our practices with regards to your personal information, please contact us at <b>support@leadsopedia.com.</b>  
        </p>
        <p>
            This CCPA policy applies only to California consumers and the Personal Information of California consumers.
        </p>
        <h1 class="my-3 large">>1. CCPA Policy Requirements</h1>
        <p>
            According to the CCPA guidelines, privacy policies must inform consumers about:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The personal information categories the business has collected. 
            </li>
            <li>
                The intended use purposes for each category. 
            </li>
            <p> 
                In addition, you must also include disclosures if you collect additional personal information categories or use collected personal information for unrelated purposes.
            </p>
            <p> 
                Companies must be diligent about identifying where their privacy policies live across their digital properties. Each and every one of these must be updated appropriately and consistently maintained.
            </p>
            <p> 
                In the fast-moving world, privacy policies that are most effective will be designed rapidly so they can be seen and accepted on any device. And keeping a detailed version history to track changes is a smart move, too.
            </p>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            CCPA Consumer Notice Requirements
        </h3>
        <p>
            Not only do you have to circulate/publish an updated and fully CCPA-compliant privacy policy, but you also have to tell your contacts about it, too.
        </p>
        <p>
            Under the CCPA regulation, this action is called “notice” and often takes the form of an email marketing message. It can also include short-form notices such as web forms, just-in-time pop-ups in website, and even cookies banners.  It requires that “at or before the point of collection” companies reveal to consumers the categories of personal information the company collects and for what purpose the information is used by the company.
        </p>
        <p>
            This includes personal information collected, disclosed, or sold. That means third parties involved with the business and the use of data also have to be revealed in the CCPA notice.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most importantly, the notice should give consumers the opportunity to opt-out of the sale of their personal data.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Automate CCPA Compliance with Technology
        </h3>
        <p>
            Implementing the CCPA requirements for privacy policies and notices can be a handful.
        </p>
        <p>
            Privacy management technology allows you to centrally update, host, and manage internal and external policies and notices across all digital assets. You can access libraries of CCPA-compliant privacy policy and notice templates, too.
        </p>
        <p>
            In fact, technology automates the entire process so you can get back to what’s important.

            EXERCISING ACCESS, DATA PORTABILITY, AND DELETION RIGHTS
        </h2>
        <p>
            To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by sending us a message on our website. Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your Personal Information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within 12 months. The verifiable consumer request must:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information or an authorized representative.
            </li>
            <li>
                Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the Personal Information relates to you.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.
        </p>
        <p>
            Response Timing and Format
        </p>
        <p>
            We try to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.
        </p>
        <p>
            Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12 months preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your Personal Information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance, specifically by electronic mail communication.
        </p>
        <p>
            We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
        </p>
        <h2>
            OPT-OUT AND OPT-IN RIGHTS
        </h2>
        <p>
            If you are 16 years of age or older, you have the right to direct us to not sell your Personal Information at any time (the “right to opt-out”). We do not sell the Personal Information of consumers if less than 16 years of age unless we receive affirmative authorization (the “right to opt-in”) from either the consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age or the parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in to Personal Information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us at email:  support@leadsopedia.com. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We will only use Personal Information provided in an opt-out request to review and comply with the request.
        </p>
        <h2>
            NON-DISCRIMINATION
        </h2>
        <p>
            We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. However, note that many features of our website, our products, or our services will not function without your Personal Information. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Deny you goods or services.
            </li>
            <li>
                Charge you different prices or rates for goods or services, including through granting discounts or other benefits, or imposing penalties.
            </li>
            <li> 
                Provide you a different level or quality of goods or services.
            </li>
            <li> 
                Suggest that you may receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            However, we may offer you certain financial incentives permitted by the CCPA that can result in different prices, rates, or quality levels. Any CCPA-permitted financial incentive we offer will reasonably relate to your Personal Information’s value and contain written terms that describe the program’s material aspects. Participation in a financial incentive program requires your prior opt-in consent, which you may revoke at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
            California’s “Shine the Light” law (Civil Code Section § 1798.83) permits users who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send us an electronic message through our website or write us at our email address listed on our webpage.
