        <p>
            Leadsopedia API allows you to access and build your own application that interact with
            Leadsopedia Features.
            Our API provides a RESTful interface with JSON-formatted responses to access most
            resources.
            By using the following endpoint: <a
                href="https://api.leadsopedia.com">api.leadsopedia.com</a>,
            There is only one current versions
            of the API that covers the functionality of the system at the moment and we are
            continuously working on expanding our API functionality, so stay tuned!
