                    In a nutshell, Account Based Marketing (ABM) is a marketing tactic that flips the traditional sales
                    funnel on its head. With ABM, B2B marketers don’t reach out to a wide audience, convert a small segment
                    of that audience as leads, and then move these leads down a funnel. Instead, they start by identifying
                    key accounts they want to target, and move backwards from there.
                </p>
                <p class="lead my-5">
                    The way we look at it, ABM is a strategic way of taking your personalization efforts to the next level.
                    You’re already segmenting your email list, and crafting personalized email campaigns that are targeted
                    to your different buckets of leads. Why not take it a step further, and deal with each account on an
                    individual basis?

                    Account Based Marketing vs Account Based Selling vs Account Based Prospecting

                <p class="lead my-5">
                    What’s the difference between Account Based Marketing, Account Based Selling, and Account Based
                    Prospecting? The first two terms are essentially the same thing; that’s the act of first identifying key
                    accounts, then attempting to sell to them using a 100% personalized pitch. Account Based Prospecting, on
                    the other hand, simply deals with the first step of the process. Finally, there’s also the term “Key
                    Account Marketing”; this is less widely used, but it refers to the same thing as ABM.

                    Key Benefits of Account Based Marketing
                </h2>
                <p class="lead my-5">
                    Companies who use ABM strategies tend to enjoy shorter sales cycles and find it easier to retain their
                    customers. They’re also able to align their marketing and sales teams more effectively, and stand out
                    from their competitors. Read on to find out more!
                </p>
                <h4 class="my-5">1 Shorten sales cycles</h4>
                <p class="lead my-5">
                    Statistics show that the average B2B purchase requires 5.4 people to formally sign off. Assuming you’re
                    doing things the old-school way (and marketing to a single lead), this means you’ll have to grapple with
                    a long-drawn out sales cycle.
                </p>
                <p class="lead my-5">
                    Think about it: after you get into the good books of your lead, they’ll rope their colleagues into the
                    picture, and you have to jump through the hoops again. Once you convince these other people, you might
                    then need to speak to the CFO or the Finance team, and that complicates and prolongs the process yet
                    again.
                </p>
                <p class="lead my-5">
                    Luckily, there’s an easier way to do this. Simply switch to ABM, where you’re targeting accounts instead
                    of individual leads. This way, you start by addressing all the decision makers together. This helps you
                    shorten your sales cycle, and streamline the sales process.
                </p>
                <h4 class="my-5">
                    2 Keep marketing and sales teams aligned
                </h4>
                <p class="lead my-5">
                    In most companies, marketing and sales teams aren’t on the same page. At best, the two teams might work
                    as separate entities; at worst, they might be at loggerheads, and constantly try to undermine each
                    other. As you might imagine, this breeds unproductivity and inefficiency.
                </p>
                <p class="lead my-5">
                    That said, switching to an ABM approach can help marketing and sales teams bridge the gap. More
                    specifically, studies show that 91% of ABM marketers say that they are either “tightly” or “somewhat or
                    moderately” aligned with their sales colleagues.
                </p>
                <p class="lead my-5">
                    How does ABM help marketing and sales teams to see eye to eye? Since ABM puts the customer at the
                    forefront, it forces your employees to come together to define and agree upon the ideal customer
                    profile. With ABM, you’re targeting accounts who have been prequalified and determined to be a good fit.
                    This eliminates the possibility of the sales team coming back to marketing, with the grouse that the
                    leads they’ve been fed aren’t high-quality.
                </p>
                <h4 class="my-5">
                    3 Stand out from competitors
                </h4>
                <p class="lead my-5">
                    Most marketers rely on lead magnets and other forms of content to reach out to potential customers. This
                    strategy might have been particularly effective five to 10 years back, when not many companies were
                    investing in valuable, insightful content. But today, the benchmark is drastically higher, and pretty
                    much every B2B company is creating great content. Bearing this in mind, it’ll be hard to entice
                    potential customers with a standard eBook or whitepaper.
                </p>
                <p class="lead my-5">
                    That’s where ABM comes in. With ABM, you’re not creating a few generic lead magnets and hoping that your
                    target audience will bite — instead, you’re coming up with a content strategy or pitch that’s customized
                    and personalized for each account. By taking this approach, you can ensure that your offer is highly
                    relevant, and that you target your leads’ pain points in a laser-focused way. This makes it easier for
                    you to stand out from the crowd, and capture your customer’s attention and interest.

                    4 Better customer retention
                </h4>
                <p class="lead my-5">
                    Last but not least, companies who utilize ABM strategies find it easier to retain and expand their
                    existing client relationships. Why is this the case? As we mentioned previously, ABM involves putting
                    the customer at the forefront. Since ABM marketers focus on building a relationship with their customer,
                    and personalizing the offer to serve the customer’s needs better, this sets the stage for a closer
                    working relationship and higher retention rates moving forward.
                </p>
                <p class="lead my-5">
                    Remember: acquiring a new customer costs five times more than retaining an existing customer, and simply
                    focusing on generating new customers isn’t a sustainable strategy for the long-run. That’s why it’s
                    important to build relationships with customers (using ABM strategies!), and keep them around for the
                    long run.

                    ROI of Account Based Marketing
                </h2>
                <p class="lead my-5">
                    If you’re wondering why ABM is so popular, it’s because this approach is proven to generate positive
                    ROI.
                </p>
                <p class="lead my-5">
                    First and foremost, B2B customers who perceive supplier or vendor content to be tailored to their
                    specific needs are, on average, 40% more willing to buy from that vendor. On an intuitive level, this
                    makes sense — buyers would naturally want to purchase from a vendor or company which puts more effort
                    into serving them and understanding their needs.
                </p>
                <p class="lead my-5">
                    The numbers check out on the other side too, with 80% of marketers who measure ROI saying that ABM
                    initiatives outperform other marketing strategies and investments. On top of that, 60% of marketers who
                    have used ABM for at least a year report a revenue increase of at least 10%, and 19% of these marketers
                    report a revenue increase of 30% or greater.
                </p>
                <p class="lead my-5">
                    Why does ABM contribute to a better bottom line? The benefits we talked about earlier (ABM shortens
                    sales cycles, and it increases customer retention) definitely play a role. That said, another important
                    factor is how ABM allows companies to focus on the 20% of their customers who generate 80% of their
                    revenue. (For those unfamiliar with this concept, check out Pareto’s Principle).
                </p>
                <p class="lead my-5">
                    In essence, ABM is all about being selective, and focusing your efforts on the high-potential, high
                    Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) customers. Going for quality, not quantity will pay off in leaps and
                    bounds: companies who utilize ABM approaches tend to increase their average contract value by 35% to
                    40%.

                    Which businesses should use Account Based Marketing?
                </h2>
                <p class="lead my-5">
                    Back when ABM was new, it was very much restricted to enterprise-level organizations with significant
                    manpower and resources. After all, if you’re a small company with limited time and resources, then this
                    makes it difficult for you to personalize your outreach to each account that you’re hoping to land.
                </p>
                <p class="lead my-5">
                    Now that ABM has matured, though, that’s no longer the case. There are plenty of tools and resources
                    that help companies automate part of their ABM efforts, and this makes utilizing ABM feasible even for
                    smaller companies. Bearing this in mind, ABM is now a great option for companies of all sizes.

                <p class="lead my-5">
                    The most challenging part of ABM is identifying the key accounts (and the associated decision-makers)
                    that you want to target, but UpLead makes this task a lot simpler.
                </p>

                    In a nutshell, UpLead is a lead generation platform that allows you to quickly and easily find leads and

                <p class="lead my-5">
                    To do this, do a deep-dive with your team and identify common patterns among the clients that bring you
                    the most revenue. Now, this is pretty similar to coming up with a Buyer’s Persona, but keep in mind that
                    you’re looking to target an entire organization, not a specific lead or person.

                <p class="lead my-5">
                    Some factors that you might want to take into consideration include: industry, company size, number of
                    years established, geographic location, annual revenue, and profit margin.

                    Once you’ve identified the accounts you want to target, it’s time to hone in on the key decision makers
                    who you can reach out to. This step is all about online research, so look at each account’s website and
                    see if you can find their organizational chart, and check out people affiliated to the account on
                    LinkedIn.

                    Now that you know who are the key decision makers in each account, it’s time to dig out their contact
                    information. Don’t worry, you don’t need to trawl through the web and hunt down each person’s email
                    address and contact information; you can simply use UpLead.
